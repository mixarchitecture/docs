## What is Mix Architecture?

<span className="text-primary">Mix Architecture</span>; is a project that aims to write simpler, understandable, flexible, lightweight and maintainable code by taking a good architectural approach and applying appropriate design patterns for any platform.

## Why Mix Architecture?

Often times, you may have thoughts such as:

- CQRS or Clean Architecture?
- Hexagonal or Clean Architecture?
- Saga Pattern or Event Driven?

Yes, it's actually kind of weird to ask such questions. Because neither actually affects the other. What if we use them all together?

But... we can't take all aspects of it. Yes that's true. So who wants this?

We must think like a sculptor. Although all of them have a positive side, they can have a negative side or there is a problem that they cannot solve. Here we can get help from other architectures.

Likewise, there is no single correct design pattern. Just like pixels; together they will be able to create a beautiful picture.

Ohoho! Super example. Because throughout Mix Architecture, we will break everything down as much as possible, regardless of frontend or backend.

Hooppp! I see someone there with an OOP background! Yes, actually this will get us to go OOP. When I say OOP here, I'm talking about Object Oriented Programming, not ClassOriented Programming. Yep, this place is awesome.

In other words, each pixel corresponds to a meaning on its own. A pixel by itself is a pixel. When the pixels come together, they form a beautiful picture.

Anyway, that's enough detail in the introduction! If you see several pages in the left menu, check them out! If the left menu is still empty, it's likely that improvements are in progress.
